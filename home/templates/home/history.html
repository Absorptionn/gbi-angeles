        <div class="page-3">
            <p>My involvement with the DIABLO SQUADS, CRIME BUSTER (DSCB), began when I
                met Leborio Jangao Jr. in a classroom in St. Peter’s College, Iligan City, Lanao Del Norte, in
                1980. We were in the same Liberal Arts Department, taking up Bachelor of Arts, Major in
                Political Science (AB-Pol Sci). He was fondly called “Django.” When Django learned that I was
                an Investigator in the Military Police unit based in Pala-o, Iligan City, he introduced himself that
                he was with the Philippine Constabulary (PC) Tipanoy. He talked to me about his fellow PC who
                had been recommended by our unit for dismissal from the service.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-4">
            <p>From then on, he befriended me and told me about his organization. He explained to me
                what his association was all about. He enticed me to join them, as according to him I would be a
                big factor to the Original Squad of the “DSCB” being in a unit regarded as the “Enforcer of
                Military Laws.” It was still Martial Law in the entire Philippines then and our unit was
                empowered to arrest and detain abusive members of the AFP and the INP. I was adamant at first
                since I didn’t want to have any marking in my body. The following day and the day after, he kept
                on talking to me about the “Diablo Squad,” until such time that I was ready to be marked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-5">
            <p>I invited ABRAHAM to our “barracks” in the MP’s Delta Company Headquarters. He
                prepared the marking paraphernalia (Eight needles and India ink). He told me it could be painful
                so he recommended to me to take some shots of “Tanduay.” While I was being marked, some
                curious MP personnel surrounded us, asking “What?” “Why?”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-6">
            <p>In between “ouch” and shots of Tanduay, I explained to them, with ABRAHAM’s help,
                about the “DS.” I was marked “CARLOMAGNO 80-1-13” as one of the “Original 1980
                DIABLO SQUAD.” Being one of the most respected Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) in
                the Brigade, as some of the MP’s in Iligan City were my students in their Basic Military Training
                while others were my classmates and fellow NCOs, it was easier for me to convince them to join
                me. In no time I was able to recruit several members of the MP’s Delta Company, including
                (now) big names such as Catalino “CRAME” Herrera, Jr. ...</p>

        <div class="page-8">
            <p>Not long after, most of the personnel of the First MP Battalion’s Delta Company in Iligan
                City and Ozamis City, and Charlie Company in Marawi City became members of the DSCB.
                The Delta Company in Iligan City had two Mini-Cruiser Jeeps used in patrolling around the city
                to enforce military laws, apprehend drunken soldiers on off duty and respond to complaints of
                civilians against erring military and police personnel. Soldiers and policemen feared getting
                arrested by the MPs. Carrying long firearms in public places even in uniform was strictly
                prohibited.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-9">
            <p>One day, our MP Patrol Team accosted three uniformed soldiers carrying Armalite
                Rifles in the public market while on marketing. It turned out that one of them was a member of
                DSCB. Instead of getting apprehended, he got hugs, the customary greeting of DSCB, from the
                MPs and just warned not to display their long firearms within the city. By words of mouth, that
                incident spread all over their unit, which encourage most of them to join the DSCB.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-10">
            <p>Those soldiers who joined the DSCB took the initiative of policing their ranks, and
                avoiding the commission of any violation of laws, rules and regulations when they were in Iligan
                City. They didn’t want to embarrass their “Bros.” in the MPs. Their animosity towards the MP
                Brigade changed. Most of the time, whenever in Iligan City, they would come to our
                Headquarters to pay us a visit while their rifles having been deposited in our Checkpoint. Since
                then our unit was able to reach out to other military and police personnel in the area. Per our
                statistics, the number of complaints by civilians against military and police, and the number of
                cases of clashes and fighting among the members of the AFP and the INP in the region had
                tremendously gone down.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-11">
            <p>Then First Lieutenant Gil Taojo Jr PC was recruited by ABRAHAM and marked
                “LAPU2 80-1” He was the first AFP commissioned officer who joined the DSCB and first to
                sport the “SGF” (Supreme Godfather) mark. In the later part of the ‘80’s, Captain Anastacio
                Labitad PA came to Iligan City as our Commanding Officer. As part of my briefing to him, I
                informed him about the DSCB. I told him he was welcome to join us. He did not make any
                comment. One day, when ABRAHAM was marking one of my members, we were surprised to
                see Captain Labitad taking off his shirt and said he would like to be marked. He said his
                pseudonym would be PATTON.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-12">
            <p>After being marked (PATTON 80-0, ), we designated him as
                “Supreme Founder Consultant” Soon thereafter, Police Lieutenant Lilia “AMAZONA” Buala
                INP, then Station Commander of Linamon (Lanao del Norte) Police Station, was recruited by
                ABRAHAM. More soldiers from the Philippine Army’s nearby Engineering and Infantry
                Battalions joined the DSCB, including some Company Commanders with the ranks of 2LT, 1LT
                and CAPT who were then subsequently marked “SGF.” The DSCB started to grow, building a
                strong brotherhood among the members of the AFP and the INP</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-13">
            <p> An individual or group of
                military and police personnel whenever they were in a drinking establishment in the city, would
                no longer keep on looking over their shoulders for fear of trouble that could arise from the other
                tables as most of them were DSCB members and a very friendly mood would dominate the
                place.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-14">
            <p>Taking into account the growing membership of the DSCB, ABRAHAM thought of
                enacting a DSCB Constitution and By-Laws that would govern and shall be observed by all
                members. He consulted me several times in regard to the acronym of DIABLO and some other
                provisions of the By-Laws. Most of its provisions, however, were done through the help of our
                MAGIC GROUP who were prominent lawyers in the city, including Fiscal Ulysses Lagcao,
                Atty. Roberto Albulario, Atty. Andrew Damayo, and our college instructors, Attorneys Nick
                Palangan and Angel Mencias. LAPU2 also helped in some provisions of the By-Laws.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-15">
            <p> When it
                was finalized, we held the convention to ratify our By-Laws on April 20, 1982 at Mindanao State
                University-Iligan Institute of Technology. The convention was a whole day affair, presided by
                ABRAHAM and assisted by me, being the Association Secretary/DS-1, and Sgt Bonacleto
                “ISAGANI” Caliso (GRF) PC, the Secretary of the Meeting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-16">
            <p>After the ratification of the By-Laws, more members of the different AFP and INP units
                in the area joined us. Most military commanders had noticed the significant reduction of cases
                involving their men, as most DSCB members began to value their dual roles as components of
                their units and as part of the DSCB, obligated to uphold the principles embodied in the DSCB
                By-Laws and at the same time as personnel of the AFP and INP, the protectors of the people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-17">
            <p>With those major developments, most military commanders in the area had mixed
                reactions over the membership of their men with the DSCB. Some commanders even supported
                our activities, such as meetings, conventions, get together parties and other social activities.
                However, few commanders were skeptical and unsupportive to the cause of the DSCB. They
                didn’t like the DSCB simply because of its name “DIABLO SQUAD” that according to them,
                who were mostly devout Catholics, was offensive to their faith. They suggested to us to change
                its name. ABRAHAM and I decided to call for a meeting of the top officers of the DSCB which
                was held at the house of LAPU2 in Pala-o, Iligan City.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-18">
            <p>During our meeting, ABRAHAM related to us his dialogue with the PC/INP Regional
                Commander (RC) who had expressed negative reaction over the DSCB. According to
                ABRAHAM, he explained the good side of the DSCB and he had convinced the RC on the noble
                objectives of the association, however, suggested to have the name “DIABLO” changed. I
                supported the position of ABRAHAM to change the name of the DSCB and submitted the matter
                to the body for voting. Being the DS-1 and the Association Secretary, I was tasked to take the
                minutes. LAPU2 offered his objection over the change of name with no sensible explanation.
                Except for me and ABRAHAM everyone sided with LAPU2.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-19">
            <p>We had noticed that some
                attendees didn’t care much about the issue but were persuaded to follow the opinion of LAPU2
                simply because LAPU2 was a commissioned officer while ABRAHAM and I were then NCOs.
                Some soldiers then believed that the commissioned officers had better thinking than the NCOs.
                Since the decision of the majority was to keep the name “DIABLO SQUAD, CRIME BUSTER,”
                we had no choice but to respect the rule of the majority.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-20">
            <p>As far as the Military Police Brigade was concerned, the DSCB had immensely
                contributed to the maintenance of peace and order in the city. However, some lawless elements
                were not happy about us. An intelligence report confirmed that a “Liquidation Squad” of the
                Muslim rebels had been formed with their objective to kill all members of the DSCB as reflected
                in the tattoo “KAD” or “Kill All Diablo” marked in their hands between the thumb and the index
                finger. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-21">
            <p>Our checkpoint at the frontier of Iligan City detained and interrogated a person from
                Lanao Del Sur with the marking “KAD.” He was turned over to the Intelligence Unit of the
                Infantry Brigade, Philippine Army for further investigation. We learned that he was released
                later for insufficiency of evidence. No reported incident of “liquidation” of DSCB members
                occurred, though.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-22">
            <p>Sgt Maong PC, a DSCB member, of the PC Tipanoy was reassigned to Zamboanga PC.
                He spread the membership of the DSCB in Zamboanga Peninsula where Major Efren “NOG2”
                Arayata PC was recruited, followed by some officers based in SOUTHCOM in Calarian,
                Zamboanga City, including Major Edwin Vargas and Major Cabading. It was during this time
                that the strong sense of brotherhood among the DSCB members was tested when NOG2 was
                wounded in a gun battle against the lawless elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-23">
            <p>He lost a lot of blood and needed a
                transfusion. Upon learning, several DSCB members from the different AFP branches of service
                volunteered to donate blood to NOG2. The staff of the SouthCom Hospital were astounded to see
                soldiers from PC, PA, PAF, and PN donating blood to a PC officer. Such kind of occurrence
                never happened before. That heartwarming and dramatic incident inspired the DSCB members
                and served as a big factor in convincing more AFP and INP members to join the DSCB, not only
                in Lanao area but in the entire Mindanao.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-24">
            <p>Meanwhile in Lanao, ABRAHAM and I had been busy traveling all over the place to
                conduct lectures and attend meetings, symposia and other DSCB gatherings, including going to
                Pagadian City to grace a convention of DSCB attended by various members within the vicinity.
                The rapid increase of membership of the DSCB apparently alarmed the leadership of the
                PC. In 1983, ABRAHAM was relieved from Lanao Del Norte PC, followed by the reassignment
                of LAPU2 to Northern Luzon. LAPU2 had been silent what happened to him when he was in PC
                RECOM 2, in Tuguegarao, Cagayan. No traces of any activity of DSCB in the Region while he
                was there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-25">
            <p> On the other hand, ABRAHAM was transferred to Camp Crame and eventually was
                reassigned to PC RECOM 5 in Legaspi City where, like a duck in the pond as the proverb would
                say, he continued his usual activity of recruiting more DSCB members, including his First
                Sergeant and his Commanding Officer. Due to his excellent performance in the PC, he earned
                the prestigious award, the AFP Soldier of the Year, which he later used as his vehicle for
                becoming a Commissioned Officer in the AFP.</p>

            <p>After more than three years of tour of duty in Lanao area, I requested for transfer to
                Camp Aguinaldo to settle some personal matters. In March 1983, I was reassigned to the
                Military Police Brigade, AFP Headquarters in Camp Gen. E. Aguinaldo, Quezon City. I was
                designated as the Morale and Welfare NCO and the Recruiting NCO, MP-1 (Personnel).</p>

        <div class="page-28">
            <p>
                On my first few days, a close friend of mine warned me to be extra careful because I was
                under surveillance by the Intelligence Unit (MP2) of the Brigade due to my being a “Founder
                and Secretary General of the Diablo.” I tried to look for any member of the DSCB but there was
                none. I realized I was the only one as all the 12 members of my DSCB first squad and their
                succeeding recruits were all in Mindanao that time. PATTON came back to Camp Aguinaldo
                ahead of me but for some reasons he remained low key and had not attempted to spearhead any
                DSCB activity.

        </div>
        <div class="page-29">
            <p>
                I then decided to talk separately to our MP-1 (Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel) and
                MP-2 (Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence). I explained to them the bright side of the DSCB,
                including but not limited to its purpose, how it was organized and how it was serving as an
                effective partner of the Military Police Brigade, AFP, as an enforcer and guardian of discipline in
                the military, particularly in the troubled spots in Mindanao. I showed them the statistics of
                number of arrested military personnel that significantly dropped since the inception of the
                DSCB.

        <div class="page-30">
            <p>Although I was the only DSCB officer in the Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo area at
                that time, apart from PATTON, I was determined to be vocal to build a good impression for the
                DSCB so I have to keep my role-model image in the entire Military Police Brigade, AFP. I had
                practically earned the respect of my superiors, peers and subordinates, prior to my assignment to
                Lanao area, and now that I was back to the Brigade Headquarters, I have to maintain my good
                image not only for myself but for the DSCB. <i>(I was commissioned later as an officer (Ensign) of

        </div>
        <div class="page-31">
            <p>I started talking about the DSCB to some of my friends in the Brigade and explained to
                them the good side of the organization. Some of them, especially the devout Catholics were
                willing to join but hesitant because of the word “Diablo” attached to our name, while others were
                excited to join. Eventually, I was able to recruit quite a number, including our Sergeant Major.

            <p>Not long after, the entire MP Brigade units assigned in Lanao area returned to Camp

                PATTON, who were very supportive to my drive to resume our DSCB activities, we started to

                not interpose any objection to our DSCB activities, such as meetings, funeral services for fallen
                members, and other gatherings beneficial to DSCB members and families. We were able to
                prove to our superiors that the DSCB was a unique organization composed of well-disciplined
                and reliable AFP personnel. Most of our members were reassigned to the various line units of the
                Brigade. Some of them were able to recruit new members from the different major services (PA,
                PC/INP, PAF, PN, PN/M), and other Unified Commands and Wide Support & Separate Units of
                the AFP.</p>

            <p>Those DSCB members belonging to the 3rd MP Battalion deployed in Albay were able
                to recruit more members in the area. No DSCB member from the Military Police Brigade, AFP
                was ever charged or investigated for commission or violation of military laws, rules or
                regulations because of their previous training in military discipline as personnel of the Military
                Police Brigade, AFP, the “Guardian of Discipline,” aside from our strict screening of the would-
                be members and the members’ strict observance of the principles mandated by the By-Laws of
                the DSCB. No persecution of DSCB members within the Military Police Brigade, AFP ever

        <div class="page-35">
            <p>The course of fate intervened with the future of the DSCB. On November 14, 1984,
                Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco was assassinated by an unknown gunman right in his
                city. Mayor Climaco was an opposition and a constant critic of then President Ferdinand Marcos.
                The Anti-Marcos and other opposition groups accused Marcos of masterminding the murder of
                Mayor Climaco. For several days, the death of Climaco was the headline of almost all daily
                newspapers in the country, pointing to Marcos as the brain of the slaying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-36">
            <p>The following day, I was surprised to see the headlines of various dailies and tabloids
                about the DSCB, depicting us as: “DIABLO, an Evil in the AFP,” “Sinister Group in the AFP,”
                “An Organization in an Organization,” “EL DIABLO,” and many more negative descriptions
                about the DSCB. Some Editorials had the caricatures of a devil with horns and tail wearing AFP
                uniform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-37">
            <p><i>(NB: Two years after the dissolution of the DSCB, a member of the Defense Press
                    Corps who became my friend, while interviewing me on his article about the GBI’s
                    participation in the EDSA Revolution, revealed to me the reason why the DSCB was
                    disbanded. He said, after the assassination of Mayor Cesar Climaco, the Marcos government
                    was beset by accusations that President Marcos was the brain behind the killing of Mayor
                    Climaco. Some “Bright Boys” in the AFP thought of using the DSCB as the “Scapegoat” or
                    “Fall Guy” in order to divert the attention of the media from the wrath of the public over the
                    murder of Mayor Climaco, thereby making the DSCB as their “Sacrificial Lamb.”)</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-38">
            <p>I then sensed that the happy days of the DSCB was coming to an end when Brig. Gen,
                Pedro Balbanero informed me that he was allowing the high ranking officers of the DSCB to use
                the Military Police Brigade Conference Room. At first I was surprised, but PATTON explained
                to me that then AFP Vice Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Fidel V. Ramos had an impending
                order to have the DSCB disbanded. However, he was giving us the opportunity to hold a meeting
                and decide for ourselves whether or not to allow its disbandment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-39">
            <p> Not long after, several DSCB
                officers who were not from Camp Aguinaldo came, namely: Major Edwin “ROMMEL” Vargas
                PA, Major Efren ‘NOG2” Arayata, Major Marcial “VULCAN” Collao PA and MSgt Leborio
                “ABRAHAM” Jangao Jr PC. Among the MP Brigade organic personnel present who were
                officers of the DSCB were: Capt. Anastacio “PATTON” Labitad, PO2 Robert “ROBINHOOD”
                Taguinod, TSGT Agustin “MIGHTOR” Tungcol, and me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-40">
            <p>Before the meeting started, I asked: “Where are the others? Where is Lapulapu?”
                Somebody retorted: “Lapulapu is now a civilian. No civilian is allowed in this meeting.” Another
                jested: “Busy si Lapulapu sa gold mining sa Mt. Diwalwal.” Someone else said: “Alanganin na si
                Lapulapu ngayon. Alanganing MAGIC GROUP at alanganing regular DSCB, wala na siya sa
                AFP.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-41">
            <p>The meeting was presided by Major Edwin “ROMMEL” VARGAS PA. The main
                Agenda and in fact the only Agendum for that matter was to obtain the consensus of high
                ranking officers of the DSCB through voting whether or not the DSCB should be disbanded. No
                logical and clear explanation was offered why we were being disbanded. ROMMEL briefly told
                us the hierarchy of the AFP wanted the DSCB disbanded because the AFP didn’t like the idea of
                having an organization within an organization and the name of the DIABLO SQUADS, CRIME
                BUSTER with the word “DIABLO” attached to it in itself implied evil.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-42">
            <p>ROMMEL took the
                votes of all attendees. When ROMMEL asked for my vote, I said I was for the “Status Quo” of
                the DSCB. <i>(Status quo is a Latin word meaning the existing state of affairs.)</i> In other words I
                voted a resounding “NO.” I further explained my point where it didn’t make sense why they
                would like to disband the DSCB when it fact it had tremendously helped in restoring order and
                discipline in the AFP as shown in the statistics where abuses of military personnel have
                significantly decreased in AFP units with DSCB members, as compared to units with no DSCB
                member.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-43">
            <p>ROMMEL, however, just shrug it off, saying the AFP leadership did not see the
                existence of the DSCB in a positive fashion. When ROBINHOOD was asked, he said he was
                also for the “Status Quo” of the DSCB. ROMMEL sarcastically asked ROBINHOOD if he really
                understood what “Status Quo” meant. ROBINHOOD bluntly retorted he clearly knew what
                “Status Quo” meant. ABRAHAM on the other hand, gave some sort of justification over the
                existence of the DSCB but his opinion was left unheard. Everyone voted for the disbandment of
                the DSCB, except me, ROBINHOOD and ABRAHAM. THE VOTES OF THE MAJORITY TO
                HAVE THE DSCB DISBANDED PREVAILED.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-44">
            <p>After the meeting, we were all transported on board several MP Brigade vehicles led by
                Brig. Gen. Balbanero to the General Headquarters inside Camp Aguinaldo. We were first
                gathered in the reception area adjacent to the Press Room where I saw some DSCB officers,
                including Nicanor “BARURUT” Cagurangan, Edgardo “TOTOY” Palmera, Themistocles
                “JOHNBULL” Romeo, and a few others whose names I could not recall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-45">
            <p>Minutes later, we were
                all assembled to the Hall of Flags with the presence of the Defense Press Corps members
                representing their respective media groups. General Ramos walked in, greeted everybody, then
                announced to everyone that the leadership of the DSCB had voluntarily submitted to have the
                DSCB disbanded. We were then required to sign the paper relative to our voluntary disbandment
                of the DSCB. Although it was no longer a surprise for us, we still felt devastated over the sudden
                turn of event, especially ABRAHAM. We were good soldiers so we have to obey the orders of
                our superiors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-46">
            <p>After the press conference, General Ramos joined us in some casual conversation. In the
                process, I asked him if it was possible for us to continue with our organization but would rename
                it with something different. He said: “Yes but with something that would not suggest evil like
                ‘Diablo’ or ‘Devil’ or anything as long as it would not connote evil.” At this point, ABRAHAM
                joined our conversation. He then had a serious discussion with General Ramos about the
                possibility of creating another organization with similar concept to that of DSCB. Seeing the
                light at the end of the tunnel, before we left the GHQ Building, ABRAHAM told me we will
                revive the organization but with a different name.</p>

        <div class="page-48">
            <p>A few days after the dissolution of the DSCB, ABRAHAM showed up in the MP Brigade
                Headquarters and had a serious talk with me and PATTON. He came up with the name
                GUARDIANS BROTHERHOOD, INC. (GBI). <i>(I learned later that the name was the idea of
                    Themistocles “JOHNBULL” Romeo which he derived from the description of the <b>“Military
                        Police Brigade, AFP, Guardian of Discipline”</b>)</i>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-49">
            <p>We then decided to adopt and, almost
                verbatim, copied the Constitution and By-Laws (CBL) of the DSCB, with some modifications,
                adding the acronym for GUARDIANS, i.e.: G-Gentlemen, U-United, A-Associates, R-Race, D-
                Dauntless, I-Ingenuous, A-Advocator, N-Nation, S-Society, which when paraphrased would
                mean “The Gentlemen and United Associates of the Filipino Race, Dauntless and Ingenuous
                Advocator of the Nation and Society.” I requested a civilian employee of the MP Brigade to type
                the GBI Constitution and By-Laws. While the By-Laws was being typed, PATTON,
                ABRAHAM and I, alternately attended the question of the typist on matters she wouldn’t
                understand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-50">
            <p>ABRAHAM filed the Articles of Incorporation and the By-Laws of The GBI on
                December 5, 1984 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On some occasions,
                while waiting for the approval, ABRAHAM and I would go to SEC office to follow-up the
                release and approval of the incorporation of the GBI. Shortly thereafter, on December 10, 1984,
                the Certificate of Incorporation, approving the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
                GBI, was released. We were the happiest organization in the planet then. Eventually, almost all
                officers and members of the defunct DSCB gladly embraced the transformation of the
                association from DSCB into GBI, and submitted themselves for markings of the GBI, in
                accordance with the By-Laws.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-51">
            <p>With the tacit approval by the AFP hierarchy of the existence of the GBI within the AFP
                and the INP, recruitment of new members continued. The principles contained in the GBI By-
                Laws and the spirit of brotherhood residing in the hearts and mind of the GBI officers and
                members remain as the major factors in attracting new members. Within a span of one year, the
                number of the GBI members almost multiplied by five times. ABRAHAM had been busy
                visiting the different chapters within Metro Manila. </p>

            <p>Although he wanted me to tag along, I
                couldn’t do it often as I was taking my night classes at the MLQU School of Law during
                weekdays and on Saturdays. During my free time and days off, ABRAHAM and I would go to
                the different camps, such as Fort Bonifacio, Villamor Air Base, Camp Crame, including Camp
                Aguinaldo, and in various Metropolitan Police Stations, gracing and confirming several GBI
                chapters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-53">
            <p>Not long after, alarmed by the massive increase of the GBI membership, several attempts
                of the government to again suppress the Association were mounted. Some GBI members
                experienced harassment from their unsympathetic military commanders. Then Minister of
                National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile defended the GBI and even announced on national TV that
                the government had nothing to be alarmed of as the GBI was only a fraternal organization of
                officers and enlisted personnel of the AFP/INP, similar to Vanguards and APO.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-54">
            <p>Sometime in the later part of 1985, when the grasp of power of President Marcos was
                waning, we felt the restlessness of the “principled” military officers, particularly those who came
                from the Philippine Military Academy, with their forming of the “Reform the Armed Forces
                Movement” (RAM) and the “Young Officers Union” (YOU). They resented the leadership of
                General Fabian Ver, who, despite being implicated in the Aquino-Galman double murder case,
                remained the AFP Chief of Staff and seldom came to GHQ, AFP but stayed at Malacanang most
                of the time, with Lieutenant General Ramos who was then running the AFP, remained the Vice-
                Chief of Staff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-55">
            <p>In the afternoon of February 22, 1986, Minister Enrile and AFP Vice-Chief of Staff
                Ramos announced their rebellion against the government of President Marcos with the support of
                the entire force of the RAM and YOU. They moved from Camp Aguinaldo to Camp Crame.
                Minister Enrile called for the support of the entire AFP. The MP Brigade was then in disarray
                with Brig. Gen. Balbanero’s pronouncement for us to follow our conscience as to which side
                would we turn to, rebel forces or the side of Marcos. Early morning of February 23, I held a
                secret meeting with GBI members at the barracks of the MP’s Charlie Company near the
                Concessionaire’s Area in Camp Aguinaldo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-56">
            <p> I told them of my decision to support the cause of
                Minister Enrile and Gen. Ramos. I got the nod of 72 GBI members from the entire MP Brigade,
                including then 1LT Ramon “SGF SPHINX” Espino, MIGHTOR, ROBINHOOD, CRAME,
                CHE, CLAY, TAMAGONG, and ESTOY. I told them I would go ahead to Camp Crame to
                coordinate with the troops of Col. Gregorio Honasan and inform them of our defection. I told
                them to follow me at Camp Crame after 15 minutes. Armed with M14 Rifle, I left. When I
                reached Camp Crame, I was subjected to many questions by some “Rebel Soldiers” who didn’t
                know me and were suspicious that I was a spy of Gen. Balbanero, who was known as Marcos
                supporter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-57">
            <p>When Colonel Honasan’s emissary saw me, we talked for a while then I was told to
                wait for my fellow GBIs. Minutes later I saw the 72 fully armed GBI officers and members
                marching in. As instructed, I led them to Col. Mitz Templo, the Commanding Officer of the
                Security Group of the “Rebel Forces.” Col. Templo gave me instructors about our role. I then
                deployed some of my troops to establish a perimeter defense at the west side of Camp Crame and
                along the vicinity of Santolan Road to deflect the reported infiltration of Col Abadilla’s men.
                Abadilla was a dreaded loyalist of Marcos.

            <p>We were the only group who joined the EDSA Revolution who was referred to as
                GUARDIANS and not the unit (MP Brigade) where we came from. I told Col. Templo that the
                MP Brigade had nothing to do with our defection as we were there as GUARDIANS. Then
                Patrolman Edgardo “CALLAHAN” Gumabay INP, GBI pioneer and my first recruit in the
                Western Police District joined our group in Camp Crame, not representing his unit but the GBI.

            <p>The entire “Rebel Forces” were frantically prompted to go on full red alert when we saw
                on government TV Channel 4 General Ver asking permission from President Marcos to allow
                him to initiate the firing of the 105 Howitzer Cannon mounted towards Camp Crame to
                “Pulverize Camp Crame.” Marcos, however, replied: “No, no, no, Fabian. Let’s just use assault
                rifles on them.” The “Rebel Forces” sent a Special Team to capture and take over Channel 4.
                With a few firefighting and resistance from the government forces securing the area, the
                “Rebels” successfully took control of the TV Channel 4.</p>

                point, Col. Templo asked me to write a message to all GBI members belonging to the Philippine
                Marines marching toward Camp Crame, followed by some Infantry Battalions and the Light

            <p>On February 26, 1986, Marcos left the county, taken by the US government to Hawaii.
                The “Revolution” was over and the “Rebels” won. General Ismael Villareal AFP, who was the
                War Director of the “Rebellion” instructed me and other “Rebel Troops” to return to our
                respective units. Corazon Aquino became the President of the Philippines.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-65">
            <p>The whole 73 GBI officers and members, including me, marched back to the MP Brigade
                Headquarters but General Balbanero did not appreciate what we did in defecting to the rebel
                side, branding us as “Mga Rebelde.” He told us, we were no longer welcome to that unit.
                SPHINX and I went to Colonel Honasan who promised us that all the GBIs who joined the
                rebellion will be reassigned to the Presidential Security Group in Malacanang. While waiting for
                the Assignment Order, we billeted in our fixed tent within the MND Security Group ground.
                Finally, Orders came down reassigning all Enlisted Personnel with the rank of Staff Sergeant and
                below to Malacanang’s Presidential Security Group, while those with the rank of Technical
                Sergeant and above would have to look for a unit that would take us in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-66">
            <p>I was accommodated to
                the MND’s Action Center (ACCENT), which later became Investigation and Action Division
                (IAD) and renamed into Defense Investigation and Action Office (DIAO), as a Senior
                Investigator and Head, Human Rights Affairs Branch (HRAB), and later became the Assistant
                Chief, DIAO with Atty. Ernesto “SGF MATT” Matibag (then Captain, PAF) as the Chief. The
                Ministry of National Defense (MND) was renamed Department of National Defense (DND)
                later. The MP Brigade, AFP was dissolved later and all personnel who had not joined the
                “Rebels” side, including some GBI members, were absorbed by the new unit, the National
                Capital Region Defense Command (NCRDC). General Balbanero was given a non-sensitive
                position for not taking the “Rebels” side during the EDSA Revolution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-67">
            <p>Although without any fanfare, Minister Enrile and General Ramos, who became the AFP
                Chief of Staff, recognized the participation of the GBI in the success of EDSA Revolution. We
                were given a victory party exclusively for the GBIs at the DND Security Group ground, where a
                program was held. I was the Emcee, assisted by Sgt. Herman “CLAY” Malagueno PC, who was
                also with me in Camp Crame. I asked all the prominent officers and members, who participated
                and enormously contributed to the success of the EDSA Revolution, to deliver their speeches. It
                was an atmosphere of joy and the strong brotherhood in the GBI was vividly felt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-68">
            <p>During the whole year of 1986, the general membership of the GBI swelled to a huge
                number. ABRAHAM frequented my office seeking my advice on the massive and uncontrollable
                acceptance of membership from all over. Some personalities, military and civilian alike, would
                want to be members just to “ride along” with the popularity of the GBI, without really
                understanding the principles behind it. Some civilians would just want to capitalize their GBI
                membership in transacting business with the AFP, while others would want to use the GBI
                purely for personal interest such as possessing firearm legally by easily becoming Confidential
                Agents of the military by reason of their being members of the GBI. Indiscriminate recruitment
                of new members, without conducting the required background check, occurred.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-69">
            <p>For some reason and purportedly due to the pressure by the military hierarchy upon the
                AFP officers and soldiers on the issue that covered the leadership of the GBI, ABRAHAM
                appointed a civilian, Rodolfo “MG GEMINI” De Hoya, as Acting National Chairman of the
                GBI. I protested, citing my reasons that MG GEMINI had no deep comprehension as to the
                issues affecting the military personnel. We then appointed Major Efren ‘NOG2” Arayata PC,
                who was based in Camp Crame, as the Acting National Chairman. Series of meetings and
                conventions were held by NOG2. We found that the information drive was effective to those
                GBI members who were attending the meetings but not to others who were not present.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-70">
            <p>During the convention held at Camp Crame, with Major General Cesar Nazareno , Chief
                PC, as guest speaker, I questioned the reckless recruitment of MGs by then Congressman Dennis
                Roldan (MG) in his congressional district in Quezon City, where some tricycle drivers and
                market vendors were being recruited without going through the regular process, thorough
                screening and strict observance of the By-Laws. He promised to be more prudent in the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-71">
            <p>One day, we learned that some GBI officers and members formed the GUARDIANS
                CENTRE FOUNDATION, INC. (GCFI) allegedly with the blessing of Col. Honasan. Most of its
                officers were from the DND’s Security Group. They wanted to become the umbrella
                organization of the GBI. ABRAHAM came to me to seek my advice. We then tried to talk to the
                GCFI leadership but they would not want to face us. The rift between the GBI and the GCFI
                widened until it reached the attention of Minister Enrile. He wanted to see the top leaders of the
                GBI. ABRAHAM and I, along with Edgardo “TOTOY” Palmera, went to the office of Minister
                Enrile where he talked to us about reconciliation between the GBI and the GCFI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-72">
            <p> Shortly
                thereafter, we had the meeting with the GCFI held in Camp Crame. It was agreed that the GBI
                shall remain as the mother organization and the GCFI cannot claim as the umbrella organization
                and the GBI shall continue to expand its membership as long as all the criteria are met.
                Unluckily, Enrile was forced to resign as Defense Secretary in November 1986 and was replaced
                by Rafael Ileto.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-73">
            <p>On August 28, 1987, the RAM led by Col. Honasan launched a coup attempt. They took
                control of the DND Building. I did not join this movement as I believed it was a futile rebellion
                without a cause. It was during this time when Benigno Aquino III (now President) was wounded
                when his car was ambushed by the rebel soldiers near Malacanang. Our very own Oscar
                “TAMAGONG” Arevalo, a close-in security of Aquino and one of the original GBI 1984
                Incorporators, was killed trying to defend Aquino. The coup was crushed by the government
                troops, leaving 53 dead with at least 200 wounded, and a considerable destruction of property.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-74">
            <p>Hundreds of GBI members, who were misled by their Commanding Officers, joined the coup,
                especially those coming from Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija. The rebel soldiers, including the
                GBI members, under Honasan were captured by the NCRDC led by Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, while
                Honasan himself escaped.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-75">
            <p>Secretary Ileto ordered the investigation of soldiers assigned with the DND who
                participated in the coup attempt, directing Assistant Secretary for Personnel (ASPER) Ramon
                Nieva and Assistant Secretary for Legal Affairs (ASLA) Leon Ridao to oversee the investigation.
                I was designated as the Lead Investigator. During the investigation, I cleared most coup
                participants, especially the GBI members, who were merely misled into joining, and those who
                were not seen on TV wearing inverted Philippine flag. However, I wasn’t able to help those
                whose evidences against them were strong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-76">
            <p>The participation of some GBI members in the coup attempt marked a serious negative
                impression towards the entire GBI in the eyes of some military commanders, especially those
                who were unsympathetic to the GBI, giving them the reason for harassing the GBI members,
                who were being denied to get reenlisted unless they would renounce their GBI membership and
                have their tattoos erased. I talked to some GBI members who were obliged to have their marks
                expunged. They said they were forced to do it for the sake of their families who could get hungry
                should they choose to remain with the GBI but not get reenlisted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-77">
            <p>They said their hearts still
                belonged to GBI. I chanced upon JOHNBULL at the DND vicinity. He told me he refused to
                have his mark erased. He said if he could not find a unit sympathetic to GBI he would rather not
                get reenlisted. I told him there were still AFP unit commanders who were still compassionate to
                GBI. I then decided to write a letter to then AFP Chief of Staff General Ramos, seeking
                consideration in behalf of the entire GBI members who were being harassed by their respective
                commanders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-78">
            <p>In January 1988, General Ramos became the Secretary of National Defense upon
                resignation of Secretary Ileto, while General Renato De Villa took over as the AFP Chief of
                Staff. My letter to General Ramos was coursed through the office of General De Villa, which
                was in turn endorsed to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel (J-1) Commodore Ramos. The
                latter invited me for a dialogue in his office. During our conversation, Commodore Ramos
                stubbornly insisted his negative perception towards the GBI despite the explanations I offered
                citing all the positive side of the GBI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-79">
            <p>He would not listen to me but insisted his own negative
                belief towards the GBI. I felt helpless for the entire GBI. I felt so bad I couldn’t help them.
                Harassment of GBI members continued. The GBI members were left to fend off those
                harassments for themselves; some were successful, while others were not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-80">
            <p>In December 1989, the bloodiest coup attempt was staged by the RAM led by Colonel
                Honasan again, where 91 were killed and 570 got wounded. The coup was likewise a failure. It
                could have been successful if not for the intervention of the US Air Force from Clark Air Base,
                Pampanga. Honasan became a fugitive thereafter. Secretary Ramos ordered the investigation of
                the said coup attempt and issued an Order including me in the Technical Committee as an
                investigator. I was told, a considerable number of participants were GBI members.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-81">
            <p>I led the team
                of investigators from DND and went to Legaspi City to investigate the take-over of Legaspi
                Airport by the rebel soldiers at the height of the putsch, and the marching of PC personnel from
                the Sorsogon PC Command to Legaspi City. PN Captain Rex Robles, Naval Area Commander,
                and Brig. Gen. Fillart, the RECOM 5 Commander, fully supported our investigation. Most of
                those involved were misled by their superior officers. I recommended for the dismissal of the
                cases of the majority of them who were mostly GBI, except those whose evidences against them
                were strong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-82">
            <p>After returning to Manila, my team was again dispatched to Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija
                with the same mission of investigating the military personnel involved in the failed coup. I then
                found out that the soldiers involved in the rebellion, some of whom were GBI members, were
                merely used by their officers. Again, I recommended for the dismissal of cases of most of them,
                except those whose evidences against them were strong.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-83">
            <p>During the presidency of Corazon Aquino, the AFP had recorded a total of nine (9) failed
                coup attempts participated in by some GBI members who were either misled or forced to join
                because they were unit movements and the whole units where they belonged joined the uprising.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-84">
            <p>When Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo of the Civil Relations Service, AFP was allegedly killed
                by the group of ousted Cagayan Governor, Ex-Col Rodolfo Aguinaldo, my investigation team
                was again dispatched to Tuguegarao, Cagayan, this time with Atty. Ernesto “MATT” Matibag as
                the Team Leader and me as the Lead Investigator. We stayed at Hotel Delfino where Brig. Gen.
                Florendo was killed while allegedly serving an Arrest Warrant to Aguinaldo who was being
                charged with Rebellion and Murder for allegedly supporting the December 1989 Coup Attempt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-85">
            <p>It was alleged in the report that a number of Aguinaldo’s men were GBIs. In the course of our
                investigation, where we even conducted a reenactment, we have concluded that Gen. Florendo
                was not killed by the group of Aguinaldo but by a friendly fire. We had never heard of our report
                submitted to the higher-ups, though, whether or not it was acted upon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-86">
            <p>With the implication of some GBI members in the series of coup attempts, the AFP
                hierarchy became suspicious, again, to the GBI. Sporadic harassments by unsympathetic
                commanders were again felt by some GBI members in several military units. <i>(NB. As far as I
                was concerned, I did not experience being harassed by my superior officers or commanders. I
                always explained to them the good side of the GBI, thus, marking a good impression in their
                minds towards the GBI. They consider my connection with GBI as their asset. Besides, I
                compensated my being an officer of the GBI by my good track record both in the performance of
                my duties and in my private life.)</i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-87">
            <p>Despite the harassment of the GBI members in the military, uncontrollable recruitment in
                civilian sector continued. By then, ABRAHAM and I had been busy going around Metro Manila
                reorganizing the seemingly uncontrollable association. The problems were recurring but we
                cannot be in all places at the same time. We have to contend with three elements that were
                threatening the stability of the GBI. First, the military commanders who were harassing their
                men if they were members of the GBI. Second, the overwhelming increase of membership of
                civilians in the absence of proper recruitment screening, and third, some ambitious GBI members
                who had their own agenda and would like to build their own GUARDIANS factions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-88">
            <p>It was at this point when the time that I have to leave for the US had come. I had
                completed my retirement process and everything was set for my permanent residency in the US.
                Few days before I left, ABRAHAM visited me at my office in the DND. We talked about many
                things for the good of the GBI. I gave him several pointers to reign in the general membership by
                strengthening the National Policy Board and the Founders to get fully proactive in running the
                affairs of their respective GBI chapters. That was the last time I talked to ABRAHAM.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-89">
            <p>
                In 1995, while in the US, I read in the papers that President Fidel V. Ramos, as part of his
                efforts to achieve political stability, granted an unconditional amnesty to 3,731 military officers
                and soldiers who participated in the 1987 and 1989 coup attempts, with full reinstatement of 153
                officers and 1,675 enlisted personnel, including Col. Honasan and the rest of the RAM members.
                It was a sigh of relief for the GBI, hoping that harassment by military commanders against the
                GBI members in their commands shall no longer take place.
